# Cash Bot
> A discord bot for money and gambling.

## Software/Tools Used
- TypeScript
- Discord Akairo
- MongoDB

## Running for Yourself
Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

Mess with MongoDB inside of `src/database.ts` for your setup.

You need a `.env` file with a `TOKEN` entry for your bot token and may need a `DATABASE_PASSWORD` entry for your MongoDB user password if you're using MongoDB Atlas.

Run `npm start` to start the bot.
